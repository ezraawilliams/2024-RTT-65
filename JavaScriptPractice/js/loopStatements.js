/*
Consider this investment problem:
Starting with $10,000, how many years will it take to double that initial balance to reach $20,000 at 5% interest?
The algorithm we will use:
Start with a year value of 0 and a balance of $10,000.
Repeat the following steps while the balance is less than $20,000:
Add 1 to the year value.
Compute the interest by multiplying the balance value by 0.05 (5% interest). This rate will be declared as a const.
Add the interest to the balance.
Report the final year value as the answer.
