/*
The throws keyword is used to IMPLICITLY throw an exception; it is used mainly to throw
CHECKED EXCEPTIONS (Those that we are FORCED to throw); we use it with the METHOD
SIGNATURE; technically throws also does the same thing the try...catch does

The throw keyword is used to MANUALLY/EXPLICITLY throw an exception; we can then add our own
conditions and rules; we use it WITHIN the method body or any block of code.
We CANNOT THROW multiple exceptions with one THROW
