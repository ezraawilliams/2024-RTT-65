This code contains several kinds of words. Find out what happens when you
change some of these words:
»»Change one keyword. For example, change the word class to the word
bologna. Look for an error message in IntelliJ’s editor.

»»Change the word args to the word malarkey. After doing so, can your
program still run?

»»Change the word ThingsILike to the word MyFavorites. After doing so, can
your program still run?
The words ThingsILike and MyFavorites are both words that you or I can
make up. So why doesn’t IntelliJ like MyFavorites?
The answer is, the name in the editor doesn’t match the name in the Project
tool window. Right-click the word ThingsILike in the Project tool window.
From the resulting context menu, choose Refactor ➪ Rename. When a dialog
box appears, type MyFavorites in the box’s text field. After dismissing the
dialog box, the two names match and IntelliJ is happy again.

»»Change an identifier that has an agreed-upon meaning. For example, change
println to display. Look for an error message in IntelliJ’s editor.

»»Change the program’s punctuation. For example, remove a pair of curly
braces. Look for an error message in IntelliJ’s editor.

»»Comment out the entire System.out.println("Chocolate, royalties,
sleep"); line. (Use the end-of-line commenting style.) What happens when
you run the program?

»»Comment out the entire System.out.println("Chocolate, royalties,
sleep"); line. (Use the traditional commenting style (multi-line comment.) What happens when
you run the program?
