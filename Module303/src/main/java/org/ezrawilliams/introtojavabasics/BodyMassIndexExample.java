/*
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight.
It is calculated by taking an individualâ€™s weight in kilograms and
dividing by the square of their height in meters.
BMI = (Weight in Kg) / (Height in Meters * Height in Meters)
For example,
weight = 75 kg, height = 1.5 m
BMI = 75 / (1.5*1.5) = 33.33
BMI                 Interpretation

<18.5               Underweight
18.5 <=BMI <25.0    Normal
25.0 <= BMI < 30.0  Overweight
30.0 <= BMI         Obese
