1. Declare some variables - two integers - 1 to 100
2. The user needs to enter those integers
3. There should be a check to ensure that the entered numbers are from 1 to 100
4. The code should loop until the user enters a valid number from 1 to 100
5. Double variables - two
6. Some sort of calculation - addition, maybe
7. The doubles have to do with money - format the numbers in money format
8. Array of strings
9. We will do something to those strings
